# NASA Mars Rover Photo Gallery `API` `Dashboard Server`

This dashboard is a great example of how to abuse custom labels and the WebAPI status blocks tile to show a gallery of images. In this case, an API call is being made to NASA's public API to return photos from the Mars Rover "Perseverance". You can tweak which day to show, and even which camera.

## Requirements

- This uses the built-in `generic` WebAPI provider so no dedicated provider is needed.
- The code references an API key of `DEMO_KEY`. If you want to use this long-term and avoid any rate limiting, sign up for your own and replace in the tiles.
- Personal keys can be requested from https://api.nasa.gov for free.
